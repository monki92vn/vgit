--- error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:

How do I force “git pull” to overwrite local files?

I think this is the right way:

git fetch --all

Then, you have two options:

git reset --hard origin/master

OR If you are on some other branch:

git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>

--- git log --since=2018-06-25

--- git log --grep="add css"
